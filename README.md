# SystemEntryCheck
A template used to test entry signals of different technical indicators using a White's Reality Check to see how the p-value changes over time.

This tests both the original signal, and the reverse of that signal, and plots the values in an indicator on MT4 and also prints out a CSV file that can be used to analyze the data in Python or Excel.
